I had a blast in contributing to an online data visualization project on the topic of Global Sugar-Sweetened Beverage (SSB) Tax for the World Bank! This project consists of an interactive landing page and three scrolly telling pieces, which offers a comprehensive view of SSB tax worldwide, empowering researchers, policymakers, and advocates to make informed decisions promoting healthier choices.

Check out the links below to learn more!

### Landing Page (interactive maps):

The **[project landing page](https://ssbtax.worldbank.org/)** offers a high-level view of the SSB tax landscape around the world. I especially like the tile grid and choropleth versions of the world map!
