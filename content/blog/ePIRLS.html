            <p class = "author"><i>Yuqi Liao</i><p>

            <h3><img class="onlineReadingIcon" src="stylesheets/img/OnlineReadingIconTomatoRed.svg"> Introduction</h3>

            <p>Just like everyone else in our modern society, students around the world are increasingly able to access and consume online information both in and out of school. How well can students read online? How does their online reading literacy compare in a global context? The international assessment <a href="http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/epirls/about-epirls-2016/" target="_blank">ePIRLS</a> was first administered in 2016 to answer that. This innovative assessment of online reading measures how well 4th-grade students around the world read, interpret, and critique information online. The <a href="http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/epirls/student-achievement/" target="_blank"> official findings</a> have been published and the <a href="https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-database/index.html" target="_blank">dataset</a> made available, both of which provide policymakers with information essential to developing appropriate public policies in our age of online information.</p>

            <p>While online reading provides new opportunities that offline reading does not, it also presents readers with new challenges, one of which is the potential for distractions (<span class="hero-tooltips" id="tooltip_refGoldstein">Goldstein et al., 2014</span>). Remember that time when you were reading an article online, where half-way through, there’s an advertisement that caught your eye, and 10 minutes later, you finished purchasing whatever that was and completely forgot about the article? The designers of ePIRLS surely remember such moments, so they put advertisements in many webpages from which students are supposed to read and collect information. The hypothesis is that students working on school assignments or research projects will finish sooner if they focus on finding critical information and are not distracted (<span class="hero-tooltips" id="tooltip_refMullis">Mullis et al., 2017</span>).</p>

            <p>As a digitally based assessment, ePIRLS collects data on the test-taking process, including whether or not students have clicked on those advertisements. This can provide insights into the relationship between students’ performance and their testing behavior. However, little process data research has been conducted on ePIRLS or on other international large-scale assessments for that matter. In this post, I use ePIRLS data to test the hypothesis above, and to explore further how students around the world read and behave when presented with the distraction of online advertisements.</p>

            <h3><img class="onlineReadingIcon" src="stylesheets/img/OnlineReadingIconTomatoRed.svg"> Data and Methods</h3>

            <p>Let’s first understand how the ePIRLS assessment works and where the advertisements appear in the assessment.</p>

            <p>The ePIRLS 2016 assessment was completed by 4th-grade students in <a href="http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/epirls/about-epirls-2016/epirls-2016-countries/" target="_blank">16 education systems</a>. (They are called education systems because there are city-level jurisdictions that participated in the assessment as "benchmarking participants.") The assessment consists of <span class="hero-tooltips" id="tooltip_modules">five modules</span> of science and social studies topics, with each module lasting up to 40 minutes.</p>

            <p>Each participating student took a randomly assigned combination of two of the five modules. Each module was structured as a class project and represented in a simulated internet environment that contains advertisements, such as the ad for space camp in the screenshot from the module "Mars" shown below.</p>

            <img class="adMars" src="stylesheets/img/adMars.png">

            <p>Out of the five modules, "Mars" and "Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell" have been <a href="http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/epirls/take-the-epirls-assessment/" target="_blank">released online</a>, so they can be viewed in the same way as they were presented to participating students. Below is a video walk-through (also available <a href="http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/epirls/example-tasks-video/" target="_blank">online</a>) about the logistics of the assessment.</p>

            <video class="video" controls preload ="metadata" poster="http://pirls2016.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/intro-image-epirls-01.png">
                <source src="http://pirls2016.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/videos/e16_Example_Tasks_FINAL.mp4" type=video/mp4>
            </video>

            <p>ePIRLS recorded information on how many times each student clicked on the advertisements. This information, along with students' online reading performance, is used for my analyses. All analyses follow the <a href="https://pirls.bc.edu/publications/pirls/2016-methods/P16_Methods_and_Procedures.pdf" target="_blank">official instructions</a> to account for the complex survey design of ePIRLS and use all five <a href="http://www.ierinstitute.org/fileadmin/Documents/IERI_Monograph/IERI_Monograph_Volume_02_Chapter_01.pdf" target="_blank">plausible values</a> of the online reading achievement scale.</p>

            <h3><img class="onlineReadingIcon" src="stylesheets/img/OnlineReadingIconTomatoRed.svg"> Findings</h3>

In Singapore, the gap was not significantly different from zero. <font class = "textHighlight" color = "#f8df4f">The gap</font> favoring students who did not click on advertisements ranged from 11.4 points in Norway to 89.7 points in Abu Dhabi. In the United States, the achievement gap was 20.5 points in favor of students who did not click on advertisements.</p>

                    <p class = "RQ4">In 13 of the 16 participating education systems, there was no measurable difference in time spent on the ePIRLS assessment between the two groups of students. There are three exceptions. In Italy, students <font class = "textHighlight" color = "#1DACE8">who clicked on ads</font> spent, on average, 2.8 more minutes on the assessment than their peers <font class = "textHighlight" color = "#1C366B">who did not click on ads</font>.

                <div class='step' data-step='12'>
                    <p class = "RQ4">This finding does not lend support to the hypothesis that students who are distracted tend to take more time to complete the assessment. One reason is likely that the ePIRLS assessment only tracks the action of students clicking on advertisements but never actually take them to the advertisement page (or a pop-up window) where students may spend more time being distracted. If ePIRLS would like to test out this hypothesis (which it <a href="http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/wp-content/uploads/structure/ePIRLS/4.-navigation-through-epirls/4_2_navigation-to-advertisements.pdf" target="_blank">claims to</a>), the future design of the assessment may consider enhancing this testing feature.</p>

            <h3><img class="onlineReadingIcon" src="stylesheets/img/OnlineReadingIconTomatoRed.svg"> Conclusions</h3>

            <p>We just did some initial exploration on how students around the world read and behave when presented with online advertisements, using the process data from ePIRLS 2016! If you reach this point and have not been distracted as some of the students were while taking the assessment, you will hopefully take away the following highlights.</p>
            <ul class = "listFindings">
                <li>We observed some variation of students’ ad-click patterns by module and by education system.</li>
                <li>We observed higher proportions of boys than girls who clicked on advertisements during the assessment time.</li>
                <li>In most education systems, students who clicked on advertisements tended to score lower than their peers who did not click on advertisements, while they seemed to spend the same amount of time completing the assessment.</li>
                <li>To test out if students REALLY spend the same amount of time completing the assessment with or without the presence of advertisement, ePIRLS may need to improve its assessment design.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I hope this close look at the ePIRLS process data will encourage more analyses in the future to gain insight into students’ online reading and testing behaviors, including their advertisement-clicking patterns.</p>
