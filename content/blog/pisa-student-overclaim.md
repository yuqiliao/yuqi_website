Check out my latest interactive story published in the Data Visualization Society's [*Nightingale*](https://nightingaledvs.com/interactives-students-overclaim)!

What happens when students are asked about their familiarity with a math concept that doesnâ€™t actually exist? This curious question is the foundation of my newest data story, where I dive into data from the OECDâ€™s [Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/pisa.html) to explore how students perceive their own knowledge.

## Key Questions Explored

- Do students across the globe tend to overclaim what they know?
- How does this tendency vary by country and over time?
- Is there a link between overclaiming and math performance?
- What might these patterns mean for education research and assessment design?

## Why International Large-Scale Assessments Matter

This analysis comes at a critical moment. With recent federal budget cuts affecting the National Center for Education Statistics ([NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/))â€”and with uncertainty looming over the U.S.â€™s continued participation in international large-scale assessments (ILSAs) like PISAâ€”this work underscores the importance of globally comparable education data.

ILSAs like PISA provide essential insights for:

- Comparing education systems around the world
- Informing policy decisions with robust data
- Advancing assessment practices
- Understanding how culture shapes education and learning
