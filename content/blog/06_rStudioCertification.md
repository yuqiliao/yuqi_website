I was lucky to have been certified as an [RStudio instructor in Tidyverse](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/liao+yuqi) in October this year (thanks for the financial support from my organization). I’d love to share my experience and what I’ve learned along the process, which I hope may be helpful to anyone interested in teaching R.

## Signing up 
RStudio has launched its [Instructor Training and Certification Program](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/#info) in 2019 to help would-be trainers apply modern evidence-based teaching practices to teach data science using R, and to help learners find the trainers they need. Following the instruction on [this page](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/#info), I have signed up in April 2020. In June, I received an email that listed out the available instructor training sessions that I could enroll, among which I chose a session in August. 

## Instructor Training 
The instructor training sessions were conducted online two days in a row, with each day covering about 4 hours of presentations, discussions, case studies, and exercises. In my cohort, there was a small group of 16 participants from all over the US/Canada, which made it easy for interactions and discussions. [Greg Wilson](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/wilson+greg/), who is the lead of this RStudio program, facilitated the training sessions. [The training slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY) are all publicly available, but Greg’s presentation of the slides is where the value comes from, as well as the tips and experiences shared by fellow participants during the session. The training is a great way for me to get a glimpse of the latest theories and best practices in teaching. Here are some of my takeaways that I found especially helpful. 

**Create a learner persona before planning for the course.** A learner persona is a brief description of a typical target learner for a lesson that includes their general background, what they already know, what they want to do, how the lesson will help them, and any special needs they might have. I like this approach because it emphasizes on what the learner needs instead of what the trainers know or wants teach. I learned that it hardly works if a course was developed to cover more than 2 distinct personas.  

**Be aware of the expert blind spot.** Experts (if they are not good teachers) may not be reminded that there are intermediates steps for a novice to get to a solution. Therefore, as trainers, it’s important to guide learners through a concept map starting with what they already know. 

**Be mindful of what demotivates students.** I learned that there are many subtle ways in which a trainer may unintentionally demotivates a learner. For example, using words like “just” (e.g. “It’s easy, you just do this and that”) may signal to the learners that the problem is trivial. Besides, taking over learners’ keyboard to help them fix something instead of letting them fix it may be a demotivator too. 

**Mirror the learner’s environment.** In teaching R, sometimes live coding is required where trainers need to show their screen. I used to share my screen where my RStudio has been customized to have a fancy black background and some keyboard shortcuts. Such customization is highly likely not mirroring the learner’s environment and may invite confusions. To resolve this, I learned that some teachers create a separate bare-bones account on their laptop or a separate teaching-only account if they’re using an online service GitHub. Having a separate account in a laptop may also avoid any pop-up notifications from irrelevant applications. 

**Teach R remotely.** Online teaching is becoming increasingly popular and necessary in 2020. The training has provided useful tips on learner engagement, class management, and technology. I found [these](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/03/online-teaching-qa/) [two](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/03/resources-for-teaching-data-science-and-statistics-remotely/ ) articles summarizes what’s being discussed in great details. 

## Teaching Exam 
The teaching exam is 90-minute that covers pedagogical techniques discussed in the instructor training. As part of the teaching exam, candidates are required to deliver a 15-minute demo lesson of any topic that need to incorporate live coding and formative assessment. My demo lesson could be found [here](https://www.yuqiliao.com/blog/06_rstudiocertification/). RStudio also releases two sample teaching exams ([version 1](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/#teaching-exam), [version 2](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/08/more-example-exams/#teaching-exam)) for prospective trainers. 

## Technical Exam 
Next, candidate need to pass technical exams to get certified. As of now, RStudio offers certification on the Tidyverse and Shiny, the exams are each 90-minute long. Candidates could choose to take either or both exams. I only took the Tidyverse exam and got its certification. Below are a few helpful exam prep resources. 

Tidyverse 
- Study material: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (required); [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) (optional) 
- Sample exams: [version 1](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/#tidyverse-certification-exam), [version 2](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/08/more-example-exams/#tidyverse-exam) 

Shiny 
- Study material: [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) (required)
- Sample exam: [version 1](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/10/example-shiny-exam/)

## Overall impression 
I’ve enjoyed the training and certification process and would encourage anyone interested to try it out. I found the Instructor Training to be especially helpful and will apply what I learn to future teaching opportunities. I also find helpful a lot of high-quality open-source education materials (a great example is the [RStudio Education page](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/)) that RStudio offers to the R community.
