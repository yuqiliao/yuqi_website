title: About me
---

By day, I research on large-scale international assessments and other education-related projects at the American Institutes for Research. On the side (and via this website), I'm randomly exploring and mumbling on my interests in data visualization, design, machine learning, RStats, and more. Feel free to reach out!

This page is quite empty so far, so I decide to post a random poster I made.
