title: About me
---

By day, I research on large-scale international assessments and other education-related projects at the [American Institutes for Research](https://www.air.org/person/yuqi-liao). On the side (and via this website), I'm randomly exploring and mumbling on my interests in data visualization, design, story telling, machine learning, RStats, and more. Feel free to reach out!

Here's a random poster I made to cover the fact that this page is still quick empty.
